# calculator
calculator with html, css, javascript and javascript ES6 classes 
i made this calculator and i didn't fin any issues with the code but the linked css stylesheet doesn't seem to be working even 
if it's linked in the right way i don't know if it's a lack of something or maybe the system needs to be updated
so if you read this help me understand the issue.
